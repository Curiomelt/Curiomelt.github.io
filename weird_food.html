<p style="font-size: 18px; margin: 50px; padding: 50px;">Have you ever heard of cheese made of moggots, well you wiil now. 
        There is tons of wacky, weird and even good food around the world. These kinda food is most known to come from 
         ancients country, religiouns, and people who didn't have much to eat. 
         Hope this article shudders you!

    <h2>1. Fried tarantulas, Cambodia </h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
        This creepy big fried tarantula is sold in Cambodian 
        street venders. If you suffer from arachnophobia you
         might consider not eating it! These spiders aren't the usual small house spiders,
          No they are big eight-legged tarantulas. 
        They were first discovered to be edible by starving Cambodians in the bloody,
         brutal days of the Khmer Rouge rule. The tarantulas taste like chicken or kinda like fried maggots
          for many others. It has a gooey inside and a crispy outside.  It only cost a few cents, they taste
           delicious plucked straight from the burrow and pan fried with a bit of garlic, salt and lime.

    <h2>2. Fertilized Eggs, Philippines</h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
        Have you ever heard of Balut, well that's good. But that doesn't mean you wont read about
         it now. A Balut is still a fertilized egg in its egg. The egg could be a duck, or a chicken.
          They are cooked when the foetus is anywhere from 17 days to 21 days depending on your preference, although when the
           egg is older the foetus begins to have a beak, claws, bones, and feathers. The egg is full of protein, but let's be honest. 
        If you come from the western side of the world, you would think it’s kinda disgusting.

    <h2>3. Maggot Cheese, Sardinia</h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
You may have heard of the beautiful country called Italy. You know, the country with fresh wines, delicious food and… Maggot Cheese! 
Yes, it is a cheese roll filled with delicious cheechy cream. But the cream isn’t made of the cheese itself, it is made from the maggots. 
The creamy cheese occurs as the larvae digest the cheese fats, and the texture becomes very soft with some liquid seeping out. The cheese is made from goat milk, and soaked in a couple of months.
 Today this kind of cheese is banned in many places in Italy, but it is still made by small farmers across the country. But they are
 not allowed to sell the cheese, they just make it to enjoy the flavour of the it.

    <h2>4. Dried baby crabs</h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
        At Epcot’s Japan Pavilion, you can find
         these at the back of the Mitsukoshi Department Store with other popular Japanese snacks like Pocky and
          dried squid. Yes, dried crabs,and squid. It is a Japanese delicacy, and is often seasoned with salt and 
          pepper.

    <h2>5. Silkworms, China </h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
        Various insects are considered a delicacy in many cultures.
         In China, silkworms are one of those insects, and they are 
         enjoyed by the locals. Silkworms can be found in local markets
          cooked several ways or stocked frozen and canned. It can even be 
          found in local 7/11 stores around China. It’s normally served up with 
          rice or noodles, or the pupae can be deep-fried and served with your choice of dipping sauce

    <h2>6. Sauerkraut, Norway</h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
        You may haven't heard of the amazing sauerkraut, it is a
         Norwegian dish and tastes amazing. Many people around
          the world are kinda sceptical about the dish, because it mainly contains the lamb's rest of its body.
           Except it’s head and throat.
        I am from Norway myself, and love sauerkraut. It has a little acidity, it's salted and served with 
        cabbage and potatoes. 
        The reason Norway eats sauerkraut is mainly because they was influenced by the danish to 
        eat sauerkraut, but the danish sauerkraut contained duck meat. The Norwegian at that time didn’t have a lot
         of duck, so they replaced the duck meat with mutton. Wich they already had.

    <h2>7. Pi Dan, Phillipines</h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
        Pi Dan can be preserved for up to five months, if the eggshell remains unbroken.
         During the process of making these eggs, a chemical reaction turns the egg from white to transparent,
        and a snowflake pattern may be visible on the outside. They can be served in cold dishes such as salads
         or can be paired with soy sauce and green chilis for a spicy lunch. Century Eggs (Pi Dan) are also a popular
         gift for friends and family during the traditional Chinese Dragon Boat Festival.

    <h2>8. Bird Spit Soup, China</h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
        One of the more bizarre foods the Chinese eat is bird’s nest soup. This famous soup is made from
         a swiftlet’s actual nest. This small bird is found in Southeast Asia and lives in dark caves 
         like a bat. Their nests are made from their own gummy saliva produced by the glands under their tongue.
         The nest of saliva hardens as it is exposed to the air. It is boiled in steamed water, so it gives the 
         saliva more gummy, or jelly-like texture.

    <h2>9. Sushi Donut</h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
        Who doesn't like sushi, and who doesn't like doughnuts.
        Well why not combine these tasty treats. Well in Disney World you can find this bizarre 
        “Sushi Donut”, it is a sushi,
         but just combined together to look like a doughnut.

    <h2>10. Sheep Penis, China</h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
For the final list of weird food items, it is very
 unusual to see this dish everyday. It is a sheep penis, 
 and originated from china. Sheep penis, along with other animal 
 penises and testicles, served as a remedy for that problem. A restaurant in China, Guolizhuang, 
 is dedicated to serving all types of dishes with animal genitalia, such as sheep gonads on a bed of curry and 
 steamed sheep penis. People come to the restaurant to eat the food, because they believe it will help sexual health. 
 The Chinese have many wacky things in their country, but I think “Sheep penis” tops it all.
