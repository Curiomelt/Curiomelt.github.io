    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Imagine a world where energy storage is not only efficient but also sustainable. Salt batteries, also known as sodium-ion batteries, are making waves in the world of renewable energy. These innovative energy storage devices promise to revolutionize the way we store and utilize power. In this article, we will dive deep into the world of salt batteries, explore their inner workings, and understand why they are gaining prominence in the energy storage sector.</p>
    <p>So, what are salt batteries, and how do they work? Let's unravel the mystery behind this revolutionary technology and find out how it could be the game-changer in the sustainable energy landscape.</p>

    <h2>What Are Salt Batteries, and How Do They Work?</h2>
    <p>Salt batteries, often referred to as sodium-ion batteries, represent a promising advancement in energy storage technology. They function similarly to traditional lithium-ion batteries but with a unique twist â€“ the electrolyte used in salt batteries is sodium-based, offering distinct advantages.</p>

    <ol>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 21px;"><strong>Anode and Cathode Interaction:</strong> Salt batteries consist of two main components - an anode and a cathode. The anode typically contains a sodium-based material, while the cathode is made of a different compound. During charging and discharging, these two components interact, allowing for the flow of electric current.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 21px;"><strong>Sodium-Ion Movement:</strong> In a charged state, sodium ions migrate from the anode to the cathode through the electrolyte. During this process, electrons are released, creating an electric current.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 21px;"><strong>Recharge and Release:</strong> When the battery is discharged, the reverse process occurs. Sodium ions move back to the anode, absorbing electrons and storing electrical energy.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 21px;"><strong>Energy Storage:</strong> Salt batteries store energy in chemical form, making it readily available for later use. They are rechargeable and can be used over and over again, making them a sustainable energy solution.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 21px;"><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Unlike lithium-ion batteries, which rely on scarce and environmentally damaging resources, sodium-ion batteries use sodium, a highly abundant and sustainable element. This feature makes salt batteries an attractive option for those looking to reduce their carbon footprint.</li>
    </ol>
