<ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 21px;"><strong>Anode and Cathode Interaction:</strong> Salt batteries consist of two main components - an anode and a cathode. The anode typically contains a sodium-based material, while the cathode is made of a different compound. During charging and discharging, these two components interact, allowing for the flow of electric current.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 21px;"><strong>Sodium-Ion Movement:</strong> In a charged state, sodium ions migrate from the anode to the cathode through the electrolyte. During this process, electrons are released, creating an electric current.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 21px;"><strong>Recharge and Release:</strong> When the battery is discharged, the reverse process occurs. Sodium ions move back to the anode, absorbing electrons and storing electrical energy.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 21px;"><strong>Energy Storage:</strong> Salt batteries store energy in chemical form, making it readily available for later use. They are rechargeable and can be used over and over again, making them a sustainable energy solution.</li>
