        <p class="article-text">In a world where technological advancements appear to dictate the pace of life, it's easy to fall into the trap of always seeking the latest gadgets. However, this relentless pursuit of newness often leads to a pile-up of discarded electronics, contributing to the growing problem of electronic waste.</p>

        <p class="article-text">Fortunately, there's a burgeoning movement advocating for a different approachâ€”one that emphasizes repairing and repurposing old tech rather than constantly upgrading to the latest models. Not only does repairing old devices help reduce electronic waste, but it also offers numerous financial benefits.</p>

        <h2 class="article-heading">Environmental Impact</h2>

        <p class="article-text">Electronic waste, or e-waste, poses a significant environmental challenge. Discarded electronics often end up in landfills or are incinerated, releasing toxic substances into the air, soil, and water. By extending the lifespan of electronic devices through repair and maintenance, we can mitigate the environmental harm caused by e-waste.</p>

        <h2 class="article-heading">Financial Savings</h2>

        <p class="article-text">Repairing old tech can also save you a considerable amount of money. Instead of shelling out hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a brand-new device, you can opt to repair your existing device at a fraction of the cost. Whether it's a cracked smartphone screen, a malfunctioning laptop battery, or a faulty charging port, many common issues can be easily and affordably resolved with the help of online tutorials and repair guides.</p>

        <h2 class="article-heading">Meet Hugh Jeffreys: The Tech Repair Guru</h2>
